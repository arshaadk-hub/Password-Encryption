# Password-Encryption
Educational Applications
Learning programming fundamentals: Basic file handling, string manipulation, and control flow.

Understanding encryption: Demonstrates Caesar cipher encryption and decryption principles.

Understanding user authentication: How accounts, passwords, and simple login systems work.

Building simple CLI apps: Shows command-line interface design and menu-driven programs.

Data persistence basics: Storing and reading data from text files mimicking databases.

Practical Applications (Basic and Prototype)
Small-scale local user authentication system: For desktop apps or personal projects that do not require complex security.

Prototype for learning secure app design: You can build on this foundation to implement more secure cryptography and database storage.

Offline password managers or reminders: For users who prefer local, non-cloud password storage with basic encryption.

Simple systems in embedded or constrained environments: Where no external crypto libraries are available.

Limitations and Scope
Not suitable for production use due to weak encryption and no salting/hashing.

Does not support multi-user concurrent access or networked authentication.

Lack of advanced security features needed for real-world systems like password hashing algorithms, secure key management, or encrypted databases.
